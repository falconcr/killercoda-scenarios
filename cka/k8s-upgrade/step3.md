### Verify the kubeadm version

This command checks that your cluster can be upgraded, and fetches the versions you can upgrade to. It also shows a table with the component config version states:

```plain
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.31.2
```{{exec}}

After updating kubeadm, you should also update kubectl and kubelet on your cluster nodes.

Prepare the node for maintenance by marking it unschedulable and evicting the workloads:

```plain
kubectl drain controlplane --ignore-daemonsets
```{{exec}}

Upgrade the kubelet and kubectl:
```plain
sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && \
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubelet='1.31.2-1.1' kubectl='1.31.2-1.1' && \
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
```{{exec}}

Restart the kubelet:
```plain
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```{{exec}}

Bring the node back online by marking it schedulable:
```plain
kubectl uncordon controlplane
```{{exec}}

Verify that the controlplane was updated to 1.31.2:

```plain
kubectl get nodes
``````{{exec}}

```bash
NAME           STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION
